audience:
  - title: "Organizers"
    body: |
      Publish adventure stages with predictable layouts,
      symbols, and exports now—then adopt scrutineering
      data, penalties, and timing as the FIA profile lands.
  - title: "Competitors"
    body: |
      Practice on legible, signage-inspired roadbooks today
      and stay aligned with the future competitive format
      when you step into pro events.
  - title: "Software developers"
    body: |
      Parse structured entries, export GPX, and integrate
      with basic dashboards now—then plug into telemetry,
      scoring, and compliance services as the schema expands.
  - title: "Tool builders"
    body: |
      Align dashboards, printers, and visualization tools
      to one file today, and extend to pro-grade digital
      navigation and partner integrations tomorrow.

principles:
  - title: "Structured data model"
    body: "Define distance, CAP, tulips, hazards, and attachments with predictable types. Upcoming profiles add timing, penalties, and pro rally metadata without breaking compatibility."
