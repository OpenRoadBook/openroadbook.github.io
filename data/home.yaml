  overview:
    title: What OpenRoadBook provides
    lead: |-
      The standard specifies a clear file structure, a symbol registry, and a validation surface so authors and tools can exchange roadbooks reliably. The current release targets adventure and non-competitive events while providing extension points for competitive profiles.
    bullets:
      - Canonical YAML structure (with JSON equivalents) for human and machine use.
      - Reference tooling and templates for validation, export, and rendering.
      - Example roadbooks that serve as templates and test fixtures.
      - Versioned extension points so higher-assurance profiles (e.g., FIA) can be added compatibly.

          Practice on legible, signage-inspired roadbooks today
          and stay aligned with the future competitive format
          when you step into pro events.
      - title: Software developers
        body: |
          Parse structured entries, export GPX, and integrate
          with basic dashboards now—then plug into telemetry,
          scoring, and compliance services as the schema expands.
      - title: Tool builders
        body: |
          Align dashboards, printers, and visualization tools
          to one file today, and extend to pro-grade digital
          navigation and partner integrations tomorrow.

      OpenRoadBook focuses on predictable structure, explicit units, and stable identifiers so data can be validated, rendered, and transformed by independent tools without losing meaning.
    cards:
      - title: Structured data model
        body: |-
          Define distance, CAP, tulips, hazards, and attachments with predictable types. Upcoming profiles add timing, penalties, and pro rally metadata without breaking compatibility.
